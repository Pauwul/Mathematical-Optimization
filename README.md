# Mathematical-Optimization
AKA Mathematical Programming = finding the best available value for an objective function in a given domain.

I'll use this University Subject as an excuse to learn how to use p5.js, maybe I'll make it into an website down the road, we'll see.
Feel free to use this as a learning resource for any of the subjects that I may touch on. I'll try to explain it so that any dumb person ( me ) would understand. 

We'll mainly touch on the following chapters, in order:
1. Classical Optimization Techniques
2. Linear Programming ( sounds scary but it's actually interesting )
3. Numerical Methods for Optimal Control Problems with State Constraints ( bound )
4. Numerical Methods for Optimal Control Problems without State Constraints
5. Optimal Control

I'll try to use as many examples as I can. I'll also cite some references for your further research.

## Classical Optimization Techniques
